NOTE

Some of the links referrence the location "/" which will redirect you to your personal localhost. The actual site, when using this location, redirects you to the home page. If ever that happens, just change the singular "/" to "/scaleSite" (or whatever you named the main folder). For example, the link "/evaluate.php" should be changed to "/scaleSite/evaluate.php".

Additionally, a lot of features just don't work (logout and the evaluate page). That shouldn't be a problem for us since we only care about the scale side.
